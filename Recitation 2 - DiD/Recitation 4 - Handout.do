// Editing the data so we can match the paper
expand 2 //This creates a dublciate of each observation and it appends it to the bottom of the dataset

gen id = _n //Since the data is compiled with one observation per "sheet" or store, I want to separate them between prior and post treatment

gen after = 1 if id > _N/2  // creating the "after" treatment indicator
replace after = 0 if id <= _N/2

tab STATE, gen(state) // this will create indicator variables for each state

rename state2 nj // naming one variable after New Jersey

gen njafter = after*nj // creating an interaction term

gen fte = FTE // I don't like capital letters and I want this new "fte" variable to disagreggate the FTE and FTE2 variables into different observations

replace fte = FTE2 if after ==1 

cd "$working"

save working_data, replace


** Now we can do Diff-in-Diff analyses:

reg fte nj after njafter, robust // The traditional specification

reg fte njafter nj after, cluster(SHEET) // Clustering Standard Errors by store

reg diff nj after nj#after, robust // An alternative way to run this regression

reg dif nj after njafter, robust // A little cleaner way to do the same thing as above

//ssc install diff
diff fte, t(nj) p(after)


preserve 

use working_data
qui reg fte nj after njafter, robust

collapse (mean) fte, by(nj after)
save working_data_did, replace

twoway (connected fte after if nj ==1, color(blue)) (connected fte after if nj ==0, color(red)), xline(0.5)  ///

// Any "*" below indicates a part of the exercise

* 1. Take a look at the variables "year" and "country" to see what they look like

* 2. Create a variable to indicate post treatment, such that it equals 1 if year is after 1994 and 'year' is not missing.

* 3. Create a variable to indicate treated units. Assume that countries E, F, G were treated. (hint: the country variable has numbers associated with it, and careful with missing values)

* 4. Generate the interaction term (optional)

* 5. Run the regression! 

* 6. Use the command "diff" to get the DiD estimate

* 7. Create a Diff-in-Diff Plot like the one we did earlier
